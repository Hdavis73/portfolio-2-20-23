          <p>
            With a keen eye for detail and a mind open to inspiration, I'm commited to delivering work that not only meets

          <h5>Out Of The Box Thinking</h5>
          <p>
            When it comes to problem solving, I take pride in my ability to think outside the box and look at the project from a less conventional angle, leading to solutions that are as ingenious as they
            are effective.

                Hilltop Memories is a website for an Event Center on the rise. The main purpose of this website was to give potential clients of this company a one-stop-shop to see the entire building and get an idea of what it offers, and give them
                ways to contact the owners either through the websites contact form or in other ways listed on the site. The main challenge while building this site was the design. This was the first client project I was given full control over
                designing and wording, so I went for a modernized southernesque feel to reflect the property and the owners.

                    Colleen Shannon is a historical romance author in Texas. The purpose of her website is to cater to both her readers and publishers looking to make a book deal. The website gives her full
                background, previews of every book and screenplay she's written, showcases her many awards and accomplishments, and provides her audience with a way to contact her. Before this project I had never
                worked with Wordpress, so the main challenge I faced was learning a web development system that was brand new to me. Because of the multitude of features this website provides I have gained a 
                solid grasp on building websites with Wordpress and learned how to leverage the many different plugins and features the platform offers.

                This project is a recration of my project for ILF. The project features a slider full of movies, and each tile displays the title, description, rating, release date and trailer link on click. On page load the slider displays the top
                20 movies, and the search function allows the user to search for whatever movie they want. This project required great knowledge of client side API's and pulls from multiple API's to display the information. The original project also
                included a preference option which saves cookies and displays different media based on those cookies, and a login feature for the ILF website.
