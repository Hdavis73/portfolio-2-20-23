          <p>
            I am a Software Developer with experience mainly focusing on Front-End Web Development. For most of my life I had planned to be in the medical field, but after switching gears and falling in love with all things tech, I started Web
            Development as a freelance job. I am passionate about using my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript to create beautiful websites that satisfy the needs of my client, and go above and beyond expectation. I sweat the details, and as a result
            driven person I want my work to reflect that.
            <br />
            <br />
            I am happiest when I'm problem solving, exploring and making ideas come to life. Outside the computer, I am a servant to my many plants, a baker, and an avid learner.

                Hilltop Memories is a website for an Event Center on the rise. The main purpose of this website was to give potential clients of this company a one-stop-shop to see the entire building and get an idea of what it offers, and give them
                ways to contact the owners either through the websites contact form or in other ways listed on the site. The main challenge while building this site was the design. This was the first client project I was given full control over
                designing and wording, so I went for a modernized southernesque feel to reflect the property and the owners.

                Colleen Shannon is a historical romance author in Texas. The purpose of her website is to cater to both her readers and publishers looking to make a book deal. The website gives her full background, previews of every book and
                screenplay she's written, showcases her many awards and accomplishments, and provides her audience with a way to contact her. Before this project I had never worked with Wordpress, so the main challenge I faced was learning a web
                development system that was brand new to me. Because of the multitude of features this website provides I have gained a solid grasp on building websites with Wordpress and learned how to leverage the many different plugins and
                features the platform offers.

                This project is a recreation of my project for ILF. The project features a slider full of movies, and each tile displays the title, description, rating, release date and trailer link on click. On page load the slider displays the top
                20 movies, and the search function allows the user to search for whatever movie they want. This project required great knowledge of client side API's and pulls from multiple API's to display the information. The original project also
                included a preference option which saves cookies and displays different media based on those cookies, and a login feature for the ILF website.

                This project was built for a UX design class. For the project I was only given a page of user and stakeholder needs and I was taked with going through the UX design process with proper technique. Though I did do things such as create a user persona and wireframes, this class focused heavily on user Guerilla Testing and using the feedback given. Please note, all external links in this site are to fictional establishments. For this reason, there is Lorem Ipsum text in the description and the links do not go anywhere. This is site is meant to be a prototype.
