            <!-- <p>I am a Software Developer with experience mainly focusing on Front-End Web Development.
                For most of my life I had planned to be in the medical field, but after switching gears and
                falling in love with all things tech, I started Web Development as a freelance job. I am
                passionate about using my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript to create beautiful websites
                that satisfy the needs of my client, and go above and beyond expectation. I sweat the
                details,
                and as a result driven person I want my work to reflect that.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am happiest when I'm problem solving, exploring and making ideas come to life. Outside the
                computer,
                I am a servant to my many plants, a baker, and an avid learner. My love of learning
                languages applies
                not only to code, but also to those of the spoken variety!

                        <p>For this position I was hired to collaborate with a Backend Developer and a Web Designer to build a website to showcase company
                            partners. The website provided a media slider for users to choose from a multitude of
                            partner sites, and each tile played an ad trailer and provided information for each specific site
                            on click. The website also includes a preference selector which displays different partners based
                            on what the user is looking for, and a login function.</p>
