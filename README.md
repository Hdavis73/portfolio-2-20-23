Davis Dev Portfolio
My main motivation for building this project was to have a really fun personal website to display my portfolio and all of the relevent professional information.
Davis Dev is a one-stop-shop for all of my professional history, a brief overview of who I am, my recent work, and my resume. The main challenge building this site was
how in depth the CSS portion was. I learned so many things, such as how to use keyframes and make custom properties to work with in Javascript. Building this project
also forced me to find a better, more structured way to organize a really lengthy stylesheet. These are all things I have used in other projects since, and will continue
to use in the future. In the future when I have more projects to showcase, I would like to make the skill-item bubbles clickable and to bring up a list of projects
I have worked on with each skill, that way if a client/employer is looking for a specific skill they have the option to view only projects with that skill.
